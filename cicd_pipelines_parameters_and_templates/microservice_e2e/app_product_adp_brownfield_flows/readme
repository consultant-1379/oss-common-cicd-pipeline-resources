This template generates an e2e microservice flow for ADP microservices taken into IDUN brownfield applications.
Brownfield applications are the applications that existed prior to EIAP.
These flows do not have an automatic trigger but are called by the ADP e2e cicd flows once ADP staging is complete
Example: https://spinnaker.rnd.gic.ericsson.se/#/projects/oss_e2e_cicd/applications/uds-e2e-cicd/executions?pipeline=eric-oss-data-wide-column-database-cd-E2E-Flow

These microservices can be taken into the following products:
  IDUN
  EO
