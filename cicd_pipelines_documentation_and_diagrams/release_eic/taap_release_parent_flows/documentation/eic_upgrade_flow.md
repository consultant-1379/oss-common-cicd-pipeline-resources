## Introduction

The EIC upgrade loop, which sits to the right of IDUN product staging. The EIC upgrade loop is seperated into two pipelines:

* `eic-r2l-upgrade-flow` / Release to Latest
* `eic-s2l-upgrade-flow` / Sprint to Latest

The purpose of these two separate loops is to protect the integrity of upgrade from a release version to each subsequent latest version, as well as the integrity of a sprint version to each subsequent latest version. This will make software releases less prone to failure due to some customers having longer gaps between upgrades.

Currently the `R2L` flow will run on a released cadence, with `S2L` running against a sprintly cadence.

At the moment there are no automatic triggers for the release pipeline, it's triggered manually only. The wanted position isÂ `S2L`, `R2L` & `II/BUR` pipelines are run automatically as frequently as possible.

After each II and UG stage in the pipeline, if the `II/UG` is successful, the version will be updated in RPT to track it.

## Pre-requisite

1. EIC Test Environment is added to DIT.
2. EIC Test Environment is updated in DIT and RPT (for version) to house specific data needed for CICD function, please use the following jobs:
    1. [Update-Environment-Details](https://fem5s11-eiffel216.eiffel.gic.ericsson.se:8443/jenkins/job/RPT-RC_Update-Environment-Details/)
    2. [DSC-DIT-Update-Key-Value-Pairs/](https://fem5s11-eiffel216.eiffel.gic.ericsson.se:8443/jenkins/job/DSC-DIT-Update-Key-Value-Pairs/)
3. EIC Test Environment has a backup directory created on remote SFTP.
4. EIC Test Environment has any necessary files ready for any specific CICD function. e.g. [oss-release-io-solution](/README.md) repo for observability, kube configs stored in Jenkins for II/UG etc.
